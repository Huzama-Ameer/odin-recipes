                <p> Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special
                    occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but
                    the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use. For

            <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> is one of those "What I wish I had when I
                was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend
                an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed
                to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality
                education.</p>
